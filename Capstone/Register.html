<h4>Why train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It's a <b>great workout</b>. You use your entire body...things will hurt that you didn't know could hurt.</li>
  <li>It's a <b>fun family activity</b>. Your family stays in shape, and everyone learns self defense.</li>
  <li>You become <b>resilient</b>. BJJ teaches that smaller, weaker individuals can overcome a larger, stronger opponent. This takes time, perseverance, and discipline. </li>
  <li>It builds <b>confidence</b>. As you learn more about technique, the lever, and the base, you gain knowledge of self-defense and protection. Your attitude and outlook completely change when you have the tools to defend yourself, or potentially others.</li>
  <li>It teaches <b>patience</b>. It takes several years to become competent in this art. Consistency and discipline are tools you will yield as you continue your journey of personal growth.</li>
  <li>It's addictive (in a good way). The dopamine flood after this kind of workout is something your body seeks more of.</li>
</ul>
